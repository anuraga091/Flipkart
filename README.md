# Process to follow, how to run and what are the functionality in this assignment
1. Clone the repository by command git clone
2. run 'npm install' by going into client as well as server folder from command line. (cd client/cd server are the command to changing directory)
3. After installing all the package start the development server
4. To starting development server for client run 'npm start' it will open in 'http://localhost:3000'.
5. To starting the backend server run 'npm start' it will show the port as 8000 'http://localhost:8000'.
6. The data is directly fetched from API using axios and initial data is locally seeded from the backend into database. and then fetched using redux.
7. I have used various component of React and its libraries to make it. I have also used node.js with express.js as a backend and MongoDB for database and Mongoose to connecting database to our backend.
8. Redux and its reducer to connecting and fetching backend/database data into frontend.
9. In this assignment login and signup is fully functional and data will be stored in database which user has given on the time of signup.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`



Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
